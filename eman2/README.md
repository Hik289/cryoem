Summary: A scientific image processing software suite with a focus on CryoEM and CryoET.



Installation
====================
EMAN2 is now built within Anaconda, trying to compile using system dependencies (without Anaconda) is not
supported. Building from source with Anaconda takes just a few simple steps and is normally fairly foolproof.

Coding Style
====================
1) EMAN2 follows the GNU coding style with minor differences. We use
   GNU indent to make the proper indentation.
2) The naming styles are:
   1) All source code files use lower cases.
   2) All classes and data types use uppercase in the first letter.
   3) All functions use lower cases with '_' as the word separator.
   4) All parameter names for modular class use lower cases with '_' 
   as the word separator.
