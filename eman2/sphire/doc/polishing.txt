===== sp_polishing =====
Relion Polishing: Apply relion polishing on SPHIRE generated stacks

\\
===== Usage =====

Usage in command line

  sp_polishing.py post_refine_folder motioncorr_starfile output_folder training_params --first_frame --last_frame --bfac_minfreq --bfac_maxfreq --min_no_particles --submission_template --submission_command --relion_mpirun_executable --relion_polishing_executable --mpi_procs --no_of_threads --mrc_reloc_folder

\\
===== Typical usage =====

\\ __1. Applying polishing using exisiting training data __:

  sp_polishing.py 12_POSTREFINER MotionCorr/job030/corrected_micrographs.star Polish/job156 Polish/job083/opt_params.txt --first_frame=1 --last_frame=-1 --bfac_minfreq=20 --bfac_maxfreq=-1 --submission_template='asdf' --submission_command='fasd' --mpi_procs=1 --no_of_threads=12

Note: The above case will use the optimize parameters from the training part.

\\ __2. Applying training part of the polishing __:

  sp_polishing.py 12_POSTREFINER MotionCorr/job030/corrected_micrographs.star --first_frame=1 --last_frame=-1 --bfac_minfreq=20 --bfac_maxfreq=-1 --mpi_procs=1 --no_of_threads=12

Note: In case you want to do training part of polishing then dont provide the optimize parameter txt file

\\
===== Input =====
=== Main Parameters ===
  ; post_refine_folder : Post Refine Folder: Input folder is the directory where the results of the post refiner are present. Python routine automatically locates all the required files used for polishing. (default required string)
  ; motioncorr_starfile : MotionCorr Starfile: MotionCorr generated star file which normally is saved as corrected_micrographs.star (default required string)
  ; output_folder : Output folder : Output folder is the directory where all the results of the polishing are saved. (default required string)
  ;%%--%%training_params : training params : In case if the user wants to do the training part of the polishing then this is None. Otherwise provide the optimize_params.txt file. (default none)

  ; %%--%%min_no_particles : Minimum no of particles : Number of particles to inlcude for training. (default 5000) : %%--%%training_params==none

  ; %%--%%submission_template : Submission template : Submission template for mpi command (default none)
  ; %%--%%submission_command : Submission command : Submission commmand for cluster (default sbatch ||| qsub ||| bash)
  ; %%--%%relion_mpirun_executable : relion mpirun executable : Since there can be more than one mpirun environment installed on a workstation or on a cluster. It can be sometimes necessary to provide the relion specific mpirun executable. Just type which mpirun -a in a terminal and choose the one which relion requies. (default mpirun)
  ; %%--%%relion_polishing_executable : relion polishing executable : Similar to the issue of relion mpirun executable, it can be sometime necessary to provide the specific relion polishing executable also. Just type which relion_motion_refine_mpi and copy the path here. (default relion_motion_refine_mpi)
  ; %%--%%mpi_procs :relion MPI Procs : The number of MPI processors used for Relion multiprocessing. (default 1) : %%--%%training_params!=none
  ; %%--%%no_of_threads : relion number of threads : The number of threads use during the polishing. (default 1)


\\
=== Advanced Parameters ===
  ; %%--%%first_frame : first frame [number] : The 1st frame number from where it should start. (default 1)
  ; %%--%%last_frame : last frame [number] : The last frame number where it should end. (default -1)
  ; %%--%%bfac_minfreq : minimum resolution for B-factor fit [A] : The minimum frequency range which is normally the maximum inner shell to include in enhancement. (default 20)
  ; %%--%%bfac_maxfreq : maximum resolution for B-factor fit [A] : The minimum frequency range which is normally the maximum outer shell to include in enhancement. (default -1)
  ; %%--%%mrc_reloc_folder : mrc relocation folder : In case if the mrcs images were moved from original location where they were generated to a new location. Then the user has to provide a path directory link to the new location . (default none)


\\
===== Output =====
The output is the result of the polishing saved in the output_folder directory.

\\
=== List of Output Files ===
|| **File Name** || **Discription** ||
|| opt_params_all_groups.txt || In case if the training part of the polishing is computed, then it generates txt file which contains the optimize parameters which are used for the later part of the polishing. ||
|| bfactor.star || In case of applying polishing on the data, it calculates the bfactor for applying the weights on the particle images. ||
|| shiny.star || In case of applying polishing on the data, it generates the metadata file for all the results. ||
|| Movies/*_tracks.star || Per-Particles motion estimated shifts files. ||
