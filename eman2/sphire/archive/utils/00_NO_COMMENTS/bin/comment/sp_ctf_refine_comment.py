	Runs defocus refinemenet for a single particle. It will create a reprojection of the particle
	given the known projection angle and shift parameters. It will use this reprojection to
	create multiple version of the projection each filtered with a different ctf. The CTFs used have
	different defoci in range given by the current defocus +- defocus search range.

	:param particle_volume: Particle volume
	:param particle_image: 2D particle image
	:param projection_angle_and_shift: Projection parameters
	:param current_ctf: Estimated CTF for the 2D particle image (micrograph)
	:param def_search_range: Defocus search range in micrometer
	:param def_step_size: Defocus step size in micrometer
	:return: CTF with highest correlation, the estimated
	error (standard deviation) and significance value
