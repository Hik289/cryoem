The code developed as part of the EMAN2 GitHub repository is distributed under 
the GPLv2 license, and may optionally be used under the more liberal BSD 3-clause
license. A few of EMAN2's dependencies are GPL distributed, not LGPL distributed,
FFTW is the most critical of these. So, if you opt to use EMAN2 code under the
BSD license, you are required to deal with any any licensing issues in the 
dependencies. That is, you are free to use OUR code under the BSD license, but
you may be required to meet other conditions to use certain parts of the package.
