Organize Micrographs/Movies: Organize micrographs/movies by moving micrographs/movies listed in a selecting file from a source directory (specified by source micrographs/movies pattern) to a destination directory.

\\
===== Usage =====

Usage in command line

  sxpipe.py  organize_micrographs  source_micrograph_pattern  selection_list  destination_directory  --reverse  --check_consistency

\\
===== Typical usage =====

sxpipe organize_micrographs does not support MPI. 

1. Normal Operation Mode: The program moves micrographs/movies listed in selecting list from the source directory to the destination directory.

  sxpipe.py organize_micrographs 'CorrectedSums/corrsum/TcdA1-*_frames_sum.mrc' 'CTFest/Tutorial_micrographs_discard.txt' 'CorrectedSums/DISCARDED'

2. Reverse Operation Mode: The program moves micrographs/movies listed in selecting list from the destination directory to the source directory.

  sxpipe.py organize_micrographs 'CorrectedSums/corrsum/TcdA1-*_frames_sum.mrc' 'CTFest/Tutorial_micrographs_discard.txt' 'CorrectedSums/MRK_DISCARDED'  --reverse

\\
===== Input =====
=== Main Parameters ===
  ; source_micrograph_pattern : Source micrograph/movies path pattern: Specify path pattern of source micrographs/movies with a wild card (*). The path pattern must be enclosed by single quotes (\') or double quotes (\"). (Note: sxgui.py automatically adds single quotes (\')). The substring at the variable part must be same between each associated pair of micrograph/movie names. bdb files cannot be selected as source micrographs/movies. (default required string)
  ; selection_list : Micrograph/Movie selection file: Specify a path of text file containing a list of selected micrograph/movie names or paths. The file extension must be '.txt'. The directory path of each entry will be ignored if there are any. (default required string)
  ; destination_directory : Destination directory: The micrographs/movies in selecting list will be moved to this directory. It cannot be an existing one. (default required string)

  ; %%--%%reverse : Reverse operation: Move back micrographs/movies from the destination directory to the source directory. (default False)

\\
=== Advanced Parameters ===
  ; %%--%%check_consistency : Check consistency of dataset: Create a text file containing the list of micrograph/movie ID entries might have inconsitency among the provided dataset. (i.e. mic_consistency_check_info.txt). (default False)
